Questions
    1. What is Semantic HTML?
    Semantic HTML means writing HTML in a way such that your tag-names are descriptive of their content.

    2. What is HTML used for?
    HTML is used for building the structure and content of our websites.

    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
    Attributes allow us to assign values to a specific element in HTML. We place them within the opening tag of an element, for example:
    <h1 class="title">This is a title</h1>
    In the above code, we assign the "class" attribute to this heading-1.

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
    The h1 tag is used for writing a large title heading in HTML; because we treat it like a title (in most cases), it should only be used ONCE.

    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
    <img> tags require a "src" attribute to display a picture
    <a> tags require an "href" attribute to link to a page

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document?
    We use the <head> of HTML documents to link stylesheets, provide a name for our webpage, define the viewport, and set the encoding format for our text.
    If we write "!" then press TAB in VS Code, the head will be auto-completed from a template for us to fill in as-needed.

    7. What is an id?
    An ID is a single-use attribute for use in either linking to different places within a page, or (less commonly) styling an element in CSS.

    8. What elements can I add an id to?
    An ID can be applied to any HTML element, just like a class can.

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page?
    An ID may only be used ONCE per page.

    10. What is a class?
    A class is an attribute that can be applied to multiple elements; it is mainly used for styling elements.

    11. What elements can I add a class to?
    Classes can be applied to any HTML element.

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page?
    A class may be reused as many times as desired; you can even assign elements to multiple classes, if needed.

    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
    Within the opening tag of an anchor element, set the "target" attribute to the string "_blank". For example:
    <a href="https://lambdaschool.com" target="_blank">Click here to visit Lambda School's website!</a>

    14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for?
    The alt attribute within an image tag is used to display a desired "substitution text" in the event that an image cannot be loaded.

    15. How do I reference an id?
    In CSS, you can reference an ID by using the "#" symbol. For example, to set the font size to 12px on an element with an ID of "llama," in your CSS, write:
    #llama {
        font-size: 12px;
    }

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div?
    Div elements should be placed within sections to divide them up. "Div" elements are not semantic; "section" elements are.

    17. What is CSS used for? 
    CSS is used to make websites pretty! It allows us to edit things like color, padding, margins, font sizes/styles, and much more!

    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
    To select every h2 element in CSS, write:
    h2 {
        desired-property: desired-value;
    }

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one.
    Classes can be reused multiple times on a single page, while an ID may only be used once.
    Classes are useful for styling things like containers for holding multiple text elements or pictures.
    IDs are useful when you only want to touch a very specific element, on a page where it would be hard to select that element otherwise.
    Another use case for IDs would be to create "jump points" for quick navigation within the same page. 
    For example, using IDs and anchor elements, you can easily create links to quickly pan to a contact-info box, or go back to the top of a page.

    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
    A class can be selected in CSS by using a "." followed by its name. 
    For example, to select a class with name "container", you'd type ".container {}"

    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
    If you mean "How do we select a p element inside of an element assigned the class of 'human'," we'd type:
    .human p {
        property: value;
    }
    Otherwise, if you mean "there's a class that exists that is only applied once, with its only real duty being to edit THAT specific 'p' element," then I'd just edit the class by itself like so:
    .human {
        property: value;
    }

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful?
    Parent-Child selectors are for selecting specific "children" of a parent element.
    For example, if you wanted to edit the FIRST "child" of an element assigned the class of "parent", you type:
    .parent:first-child {
        property: value;
    }

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
    .sidebar a {
        property: value;
    }

    24. What is a pseudo selector?
    Pseudo selectors are used to change the styling of an element ONLY when it is in a specific state. For example, to make a button red when hovered:
    button:hover {
        background-color: red;
    }

    25. What do we use to change the spacing between lines?
    We use the "line-height" property to change the spacing between lines.

    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?
    We use the "letter-spacing" property to change the spacing between letters.

    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
    We use the "text-transform" property to change text to all-caps, all-lowercase, or to capitalize the first letter of every word.

    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?
    If your div had the class of "cool-border," you'd type the following CSS:
    .cool-border {
        border: dotted 1px black;
    }

    29. How do I select everything on the page? 
    Use the "*" selector to select everything on a page.

    30. How do I write a comment in CSS?
    In CSS, you can write comments by opening with "/*" and closing with "*/". These can go down multiple lines, so long as you write inside them.

    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line?
    The "pwd" command will "print" your "working directory".

    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder?
    The "ls" command will "list" the files in your current directory.

    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
    To remove a file, you'd write "rm 'filename.extension'".
    To remove an empty folder, type, "rmdir 'foldername'".
    To remove a folder and everything inside it, type, "rm -r 'foldername'". You may need "root" permissions to recursively delete files, though.

    34. Why should I use version control? 
    Version control lets you save snapshots of your code at every stage you're in, as well as collaborate on a common repository without conflicting with the code of your peers.

    35. How often should I commit to github?
    As a general rule of thumb, you should commit once every 20 minutes, or whenever a major feature is completed.

    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
    Type "github push -u origin <branch-name>" to push your code up to a desired branch, when in the correct directory.

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
    First, create a fork of the repository you want to edit.
    Second, make and enter an empty folder; this will be where you'll store that repository's files.
    Next, "clone" (copy) the forked repository into your current directory, and once that's done, enter the new folder.
    Then, create a new branch to work on (using git checkout -b <first-last>).
    At this point, you may now edit your local project files as desired.
    When you want to save your changes, type "git add ." to scan/record all changes to every file in the directory.
    Following that, commit your changes, writing a message to describe what/why you're editing (using "git commit -m '<your-message-here>'").
    Finally, you can push your changes to the remote repository by typing "git push -u origin <first-last>".
    After that, you can submit a pull-request for your code to await its approval for merging into the master branch.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Inline elements take up only as much space as they need, while a block element will stretch to the maximum width it can take over.
    An "in-line" element can be placed in the same line as other elements, while a block-element will break to the next available line.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    An absolutely positioned element will place itself in the exact pixel it is designated to, ignoring the size of the browser.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    Unsure.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    <img>, <p>, <h1>-<h6> are block elements by default. <span> and <a> are inline by default. I do not know which elements are inline-block by default.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
    Unsure.
